# SAT-scores-GPA-Analysis
When deciding whether to admit an applicant, colleges take lots of factors, such as grades, sports, activities, leadership positions, awards, teacher recommendations, and test scores, into consideration. Using SAT scores as a basis of whether to admit a student or not has created some controversy. Among other things, people question whether the SATs are fair and whether they predict college performance.

This dataset contains the SAT and GPA information of 105 students who graduated from a state university with a B.S. in computer science. 

I chose high_GPA and univ_GPA colums. I chose these columns to determine if high
school GPA is higher than university GPA and to explore whether students perform
better or worse
